Here's the setup I use for Apple Silicon Macbooks. Most of these apps must be setup to run on startup. Some of them can be hidden from the menu bar (if they allow it) as you only need to configure them once.

<Application name="Homebrew" link="https://brew.sh/">
	The sad and only package manager for Mac.
</Application>

<Application
	name="AltTab"
	link="https://alt-tab-macos.netlify.app/"
	image={import("./alt-tab.jpeg")}
>
	Better window switching.
</Application>

<Application
	name="BetterSnapTool"
	link="https://folivora.ai/bettersnaptool"
	image={import("./bettersnaptool.jpg")}
>
	Paid but worth it. Position windows by dragging them to corners, like on Windows.
</Application>

<Application name="LinearMouse" link="https://linearmouse.app/">
	Allows to have different scroll directions for the trackpad and external mice.
</Application>

<Application name="TinkerTool" link="https://bresink.com/osx/TinkerTool.html">
	Can't remember what I tinkered with it but it's cool.
</Application>

<Application name="Raycast" link="https://raycast.com/">
	Replaces Spotlight and supports various extensions.
</Application>

<Application
	name="battery"
	link="https://github.com/actuallymentor/battery/"

>
	Stops the battery charging at 80%.
</Application>

<Application name="Amphetamine" link="https://apps.apple.com/fr/app/amphetamine/id937984704">
	I use it to keep the displays on only when an external display is connected, so I can play music
	through my external monitor.
</Application>

<Application
	name="System Color Picker"
	link="https://apps.apple.com/fr/app/system-color-picker/id1545870783"
>
	Allows to call the Mac color picker from anywhere.
</Application>

<Application name="Google Drive" link="https://google.com/drive/download/">
	Nice file syncing.
</Application>

<Application name="DeepL" link="https://deepl.com/macos-app/">
	Allows to quickly translate something with âŒ˜+C+C.
</Application>

## Raycast Extensions

- Coffee (shortcut for the caffeinate command to keep the display on)
- Color Picker (fastest color picker I know)
- Pomodoro
- Spotify Controls
- Visual Studio Code (quickly open recent projects)
