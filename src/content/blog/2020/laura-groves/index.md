Shivers! Love it.

sounds like fleet wood mac, amazing

her music couldn’t sound more organic

‘Blue Roses’, you see, is less Nash and more Bush, a dizzyingly beautiful set of delicate folk songs that sound like they’ve been sprinkled with pixie dust and reincarnated from some perfect bygone age. Pitched somewhere between Joanna Newsom and Joni Mitchell, Groves’ layered voice guides highlights ‘Coast’ and ‘I Am Leaving’ skilfully through these oft-travelled waters, and towards the safe haven marked ‘contemporary classics’.

Like any millennial twentysomething, Laura Groves' (a.k.a. Blue Roses) artistic statement reappraises familiar forms and reinvests them with new meaning. Her biography is unusually specific in citing multiple influences and, though comparing new artists to familiar artists is par for the course when introducing a new musician, it's pretty difficult to find any piece written about Groves that doesn't mention Kate Bush, Joni Mitchell, Bat for Lashes, and/or Joanna Newsom. Yet in spite of all these comparisons to older artists and her own emphasis on those who have influenced her, Groves clearly has a unique viewpoint and is successfully working to craft a voice all her own.

Groves overlaps acoustic fingerpicking with lavish, swirling synths, and her faerie-in-the-glen voice is multi-tracked into backing harmony, creating an ethereal pillow on which the other components of the arrangement rest. Her affinity for layering also makes its way into "Leaving"'s lyrics, which connote gathering bits of old material and then imbuing them with new meaning: "I'll tear up letters/ I'll take some pictures from their frames/ To make a story from the way I'm choosing". Forging a new path inlaid with pictures, words, and other memories, she creates a new identity-- a kind of "I Will Survive" for the Facebook generation.

Yorkshire is full of towns where nothing much happens, or so they’d have you believe. Laura Groves either didn’t hear, didn’t believe or simply knew better and on the edge of seventeen began writing songs.

With an old family piano and a borrowed guitar, thinking of the records she loved, lyrics that broke her heart, phrasing that made it race, composers cradling her aspirations. Influences spanning genres and generations; from Bartók to Bush, Tiersen to Tears For Fears, Debussy to Du Maurier. She dreamt of writing, arranging, performing and producing an album that would be as treasured by someone else, and hopefully inspire them in the same way.

Instant praise is neither expected nor sought; Blue Roses is not the stuff of lists, tip offs or hollow press recommendations; this is not recollection, it is realisation. It is not music to be forced onto the public for social measurements, or on the merit of affiliation. Blue Roses is to be found, kept and cherished; it is to be absent as the dust begins to settle, and longed for as ambience resumes. Blue Roses is the serendipity that can only happen when you thought you’d stopped looking; as you realise how life sounds without it, you begin again.

there’s an audible sense of dislocation throughout it—you can hear it in Groves’ voice, that feeling of being both in awe of, and slightly overwhelmed and isolated by, the city.

"London, I love it, but you feel almost a little bit… adrift."
